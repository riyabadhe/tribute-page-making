            <b>India</b> is known for business and Indian businessmen are well known around the world. The world
            agrees
            with the thought that business runs in the veins of Indians. Ambani, Adani,Mahindra,Tata,
            Kotak,Birlas
            are figureheads of the business world.<br>

            <b>Here talking about a businessman called Mr.Ratan Tata.</b>
            When we think of billionaire men, we conjure images of men stepping out of five-star hotels in suits
            and
            getting into fancy chauffeur-driven cars. From their clothes and accessories to their cars,
            everything
            belongs to high-end brands. Such men hold immense power and this is often conveyed in their
            interactions
            with people.
            <b>However, Ratan Tata is different.</b>
            <strong>Ratan Naval Tata</strong> (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian businessman and former
            chairman of Tata Sons.
            He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of
            the Tata Group.
            He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in
            architecture.He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later
            succeeded J. R. D. Tata's as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his
            tenure the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from
            a largely India-centric group into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest
            philanthropists in the world, having donated around 60–65% of his income to charity.

                In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by
                turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during
                an economic slowdown.In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming
                him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries,
                who had a large amount of operational freedom under the senior Tata's tenure. In response, Tata
                implemented a number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the implementation of a
                retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries
                to contribute their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation and
                delegated many responsibilities to younger talent.Under his leadership, overlapping operations
                between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, with the group exiting unrelated
                businesses to take on globalisation.<br>
                During the 21 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit over 50
                times.mprised commodity sales, but at the end of his tenure, the majority of sales came from
                brands.He had Tata Tea acquire Tetley, Tata Motors acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata
                Steel acquire Corus. These acquisitions repositioned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a
                global business, with over 65% of revenues coming from operations and sales internationally.

                Tata has never married and has no children. In 2011, Ratan Tata stated, "I came close to getting
                married four times and each time I backed off in fear or for one reason or another".

            <div class="section-title">REASONS WHY HE IS AN INSPIRATION </div>

            <div>
                <p><b>
                        There are some reasons why he is an inspiration to all:</b></p>
                <div>

                    <p><b>1. He is a risk taker</b><br>
                        Ratan Tata tapped into the pulse of Indian masses to understand their needs and daily
                        lives.
                        He realized that many Indian middle class families dream of buying their own car but
                        often
                        don’t have the means to do so. Hence, he came up with Tata Nano, the ‘one lakh car’, in
                        2009. Within one week of its launch, the company’s website crashed due to high interest
                        and publicity.
                        Though the car is no longer under production, he fulfilled the dreams of many families
                        of
                        having their own car without burning their pockets.<br>

                        <b>2. He is an empath</b><br>
                        In the aftermath of the 26/11 attacks, Ratan Tata set up the <b>‘Taj public Service
                            Welfate Trust’</b> to help the victims and their families get rehabilitated. He
                        visited familes of 80 Taj employees who were either killed or injured during the
                        terrorist attacks. Moreover, since the Taj hotel fell under Tata Group,he played a
                        significant role in re-building it and retaining its historical significance for the
                        people of Mumbai.<br>


                        <b>3. He donates generously to noble causes</b><br>
                        Ratan Tata donated $50 million to his alma mater, Harvard Business School for building
                        an executive center. MIT’s Tata Centre of Technology and Design was also formed by him.
                        He made IIT Bombay its highest donation ever by donating Rs 95 crore to form the Tata
                        Centre for Technology and Design, similar to MIT, that would develop engineering and
                        design solutions for those with limited resources. He also donated Rs 1500 crore towards
                        India’s fight against the Coronavirus pandemic. The list of Ratan Tata’s donations are
                        endless, but he has never harped on his generosity.<br>

                        <b>4. For Ratan Tata, no job is too small or big </b><br>
                        Ratan Tata started his journey at the Tata Group as an apprentice on the shop floor of
                        the Jamshedpur plant. He built his career from the ground up, working in different
                        companies within the Tata Group and eventually became the director of National Radio and
                        Electronics (NELCO). It took him nine years to move from an apprentice to a director,
                        however he never shied away from working hard and these years of struggle have shaped
                        him into the man he is today. Interestingly, Ratan Tata’s career didn’t start with the
                        Tata Group. His first job was
                        at IBM, but JRD Tata was disappointed that on returning from his university in the US,
                        he didn’t join Tata.He asked Ratan Tata for a resume, which he typed on a typewriter in
                        the IBM office and the rest is history.<br>
                        <b>5. He is a big supporter and lover of his furry friends</b><br>
                        It’s no secret that Ratan Tata loves dogs. One of his best friends is ‘Goa’, a dog who
                        rides the elevator with him to his office every morning and sits with him through all
                        his meetings. Tata
                        Sons' global HQ at Bombay House is home to several strays who are looked after by the
                        group. Ratan Tata also found his assistant through their mutual love of dogs.<br>
                        Shantanu Naidu was deeply impacted by the death of a stray dog in a car accident in
                        Mumbai. He realised that most of these accidents happened because the driver couldn’t
                        see the dog during dark hours. As a solution,he created dog collars with reflectors to
                        alert the drivers of dogs standing on roads at night. Impressed by his idea and
                        willingness to help dogs, Ratan Tata funded his project, Moto Paws, and hired Naidu as
                        an assistant. Ratan Tata breaks the mold of a popular businessman who uses his wealth to
                        feed his vanity and bolster his power.
